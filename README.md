Yo, just got outta Until Dawn and wow my head’s spinning like a teacup ride. Seriously, it’s like I’m still sitting in the sticky theater seat and there’s popcorn crumbs uh everywhere. Back’s aching, can’t remember when I got this slouchy - might’ve been right after the opening credits or when that huge shadow thing appeared, with those eyes like headlights in fog, almost blinded by the sound. Whoever does the sound must’ve a thing for bass 'cos I felt that boom in my chest like a second heartbeat.

So there’s that scene, you know the one, where everything goes real still, but not quiet at all – kinda like before a neighborhood thunderstrike when the air's heavy and you can feel the charge right through your bones. This one character, Jimmy or Timmy, maybe a Steve? No idea, but he’s running through the woods and it’s like a blur of blue shades – made me think of that time we got lost in the woods upstate and swore we heard something in the branches but it was just the wind. Or was it? Anyway, with all the yelling and him slipping on the mud, I almost dropped my phone into yesterday's spilled Coke or whatever was under my seat.

> At some point, it felt like people in the theater were ghosts themselves – isn’t it wild how a whole room can hold its breath together? I could hear someone's candy wrapper and it sounded like a distant avalanche. The monster, though, didn’t see it coming, how it’d pull a Jean-Claude Van Damme in ways only nightmares do - with those twisty limbs, all Matrix meets a broken marionette. Gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when I get a chance 'cos you mentioned it last week, remember?

It's like they mashed every obscure horror trope into a stew no one asked for but somehow everyone’s curious about. Imagine reheating three-week-old curry and wondering why it smells like your cat’s forgotten toy. Honestly, the plot was as tangled as my earbuds when I’m in a rush – can’t tell left from right but somehow the music played on.

I wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to catch what slipped past while I was too busy wondering who was gonna make it out alive. Almost leaned over to the dude next to me to ask if he got what was happening – maybe he was as lost in the shadowy mist. Oh, and the deer, God those poor deer, like sentinels of doom or just a Midwest road trip gone wrong?

Anyway, gonna text Mark about it, he’s been raving about the cinematics but man it was the atmosphere that really got under my skin like… like forgotten song lyrics. Just vibing, haunting, like yesterday’s misplaced thoughts.

Here’s something, accidentally pasted this from another tab – somehow fits though, right?
